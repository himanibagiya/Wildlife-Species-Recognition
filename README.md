# Wildlife-Species-Recognition
This project aims to develop an AI-powered wildlife species recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on wildlife datasets to classify different species from images. The application can be used for wildlife conservation, biodiversity research, and automatic species identification from camera trap images.
